    <h1>A Conversation About <em>Pinball, 1973?</em>: What Can Games Reveal to Us About Ourselves?</h1>
    <p><em>“No, pinball leads nowhere. The only result is a glowing replay light. Replay, replay, replay -
            it makes you think the whole aim of the game is to achieve a form of eternity. We know very little
            about eternity, although we can infer its existence. The goal of pinball is self-transformation,
            not self-expression. It involves not the expansion of the ego but its diminution. Not analysis but
            all-embracing acceptance. If it’s self-expression, ego expansion, or analysis you’re after, the tilt
            light will exact its unsparing revenge. Have a nice game!”</em></p>
    <p>This excerpt originates from the introduction of a fictional study on the game of pinball mentioned in
        Murakami Haruki’s Pinball, 1973. This short novel, Murakami’s second-ever work, was published in 1980
        and is the direct sequel to Murakami’s first work, the short novel Hear the Wind Sing (published in 1979).
        These two novels are part of the larger Rat series, comprising the aforementioned works, followed by the
        novels A Wild Sheep Chase and Dance Dance Dance. Compared to the latter two works, Murakami’s first two
        short novels are much less well known. In fact, Murakami himself opposed their translation and distribution
        in the Western world for many years, due to his unfavorable opinion of his early writing. The works themselves
        are certainly less developed and polished than his later works, but similar to many of Murakami’s works, they
        tend to highlight non-conventional topics. The main focus of Pinball, 1973 is the classic arcade game of
        pinball; quite an unusual subject to base a novel around.</p>
    <p>In Pinball, 1973, the protagonist, coping with the suicide of his college girlfriend, becomes obsessed with the
        game of pinball. In particular, he develops a strong attachment to a particular pinball machine model (the
        Spaceship) and pours enormous amounts of time and energy into playing the model and racking up very high scores.
        The narrator’s initial intentions for playing pinball were to distract himself from the difficulties brought
        about by his girlfriend’s suicide. On one hand, he has been heavily grieving her loss, but he also blames
        himself for her suicide. Thus, the game of pinball provides him with both a form of consolation (achieving high
        scores helps him to feel better about himself) and escape (he can focus on the game and stop overthinking).
        However, his obsession with pinball reaches the point of addiction - he gives up on school and spends the
        majority of his time playing the game, even in the freezing dead of winter, still solely playing on the
        Spaceship model. At the deepest throes of his addiction, the game of pinball begins to take on a new meaning for
        him.</p>
    <p>Specifically, the Spaceship pinball machine becomes a physical representation of the narrator’s deceased
        girlfriend. Playing pinball on the machine becomes a form of conversation with her. Thus, the narrator develops
        an attachment to the machine itself. This period of intense obsession and eventual anthropomorphization lasts
        for six months, but is abruptly interrupted when the arcade suddenly closes. Faced with such an impasse, the
        narrator begrudgingly gives up his pinball-playing ways. Three years later, after suddenly developing a yearning
        for the game of pinball, the narrator tries to track down his beloved Spaceship model. His efforts grant him an
        opportunity for a reunion with the machine, now in the hands of a pinball machine collector. The narrator meets
        the Spaceship one final time and gives it a proper goodbye, allowing him to achieve closure and finally accept
        the loss of his girlfriend, enabling him to move forward in his life.</p>
    <p>The quote at the beginning of this essay describes some of the themes represented by the game of pinball that are
        explored in Pinball, 1973. In particular, the quote mentions self-transformation, the diminution of the ego, and
        all-embracing acceptance as outcomes of playing pinball. All these facets apply to the narrator of Pinball,
        1973. Through the game of pinball and his attachment to the Spaceship machine, the narrator is able to grow as a
        person, coming to terms with the suicide of his girlfriend and forgiving himself for not being able to
        prevent it. How exactly does this happen? Well, as you spend more and more time on the game in pursuit of
        ever-increasing high scores, you have to bare your ego in front of the machine in order to achieve those scores.
        In the process of self-improvement in the mechanics and understanding of the game, you have to pour your
        sincerity and honesty into the game. During this process, this practice of honesty begins to seep into other
        aspects of your life and allows you to better confront certain questions in your life. The aforementioned quote
        also alludes to the achievement of a form of eternity. This refers to the fact that this process of personal
        self-improvement results in permanent, meaningful changes in your life, ones that allow you to achieve a form of
        spiritual eternity.</p>
    <p>How do I understand these esoteric intricacies so well? Well, I've had a similar experience with the game of
        Minesweeper. Similar to pinball, Minesweeper is a relatively simple game, where avenues for self-improvement lie
        in the gradual development of one’s mechanics and game knowledge. In single-player games like pinball and
        Minesweeper, your improvement is entirely reliant on yourself. Are you willing to dedicate yourself to the game
        and put in the requisite long hours? There are no natural-born “geniuses” at these games; achieving high scores
        is all about hard work and diligence. In the pursuit of my own high records (in Minesweeper, this would actually
        be low records), I've gone through many of the same experiences as the narrator of Pinball, 1973, and I
        believe that I can understand his feelings toward the game of pinball. How good am I at Minesweeper? I'm still
        nowhere near world-record level, but I've gotten pretty good: my record is 84 seconds on expert level.</p>
