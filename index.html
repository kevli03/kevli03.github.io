    <h1>Literature</h1>

    <h1>Murakami Haruki (村上春樹)</h1>

    <h2>Novels</h2>

    <h2>Hear the Wind Sing</h2>
    <h3><em>Rat Series: Book 1</em></h3>
    <h3>1979 | &#x1F431; 7.0/10</h3>

    <p><em>Synopsis</em>: A college student on summer break returns to his hometown
        and reconnects with his old friend (the titular "Rat") at the local bar. This student will reappear as
        the protagonist and narrator throughout the rest of the Rat series.</p>
    <p><em>Thoughts</em>: This novel doesn't seem to get a lot of love, even from Murakami fanatics,
        but I'm actually quite fond of it. The atmosphere is classic Murakami, and although Murakami himself
        may think differently, I don't see much of a gap between this work and his later works.</p>

    <h2>Pinball, 1973</h2>
    <h3><em>Rat Series: Book 2</em></h3>
    <h3>1980 | &#x1F431; 8.8/10</h3>

    <p><em>Synopsis</em>: Set a few years after the events of <em>Hear the Wind Sing</em>,
        our protagonist develops an obsession with the game of pinball and the Rat starts seeing a woman.</p>
    <p><em>Thoughts</em>: Again, this seems to be an uncommon opinion, but I think this is really, really good.
        At times, this reads like Murakami at his best. This is the first novel where you can observe Murakami
        start to develop the common themes at the core of all his works. To me, it's really impressive that
        Murakami could reach this level of writing so early on in his literary career. Truly a signal of things
        to come. An analysis of the meaning of pinball in this short novel can be found
        <a href="pinball.html">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>A Wild Sheep Chase</h2>
    <h3><em>Rat Series: Book 3</em></h3>
    <h3>1982 | &#x1F431; 8.2/10</h3>

    <p><em>Synopsis</em>: Murakami's first extended novel. Now in his 30s, our protagonist, accompanied by
        his girlfriend, explores the wintry landscapes of Hokkaido in pursuit of the traces of the Rat and a mysterious
        sheep with a star-shaped mark.</p>
    <p><em>Thoughts</em>: I really enjoyed the first half of this novel. It's about as Murakami as you can get,
        filled with lengthy exposition about subjects such as the history of Japanese sheep and the Ainu people
        with just enough interspersed plot development to keep readers engaged in the larger story. The second
        half of the novel is much more plot-focused and "engaging", but I didn't really find myself caring too much
        about the final fate of the Rat. Perhaps I just need to give this one a re-read.</p>

    <h2>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</h2>
    <h3>1985 | &#x1F431; <span style="color:gold">10</span>/10</h3>

    <p><em>Synopsis</em>: A middle-aged man is caught up in an information war between secretive opposing factions.
        In a parallel narrative, a newcomer to a mysterious town known as "The End of the World" seeks to
        uncover the truth behind the town's existence.</p>
    <p><em>Thoughts</em>: This could be Murakami's all-time best work. It doesn't have the emotional power of
        <em>Norwegian Wood</em> or the literary polish of <em>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</em>, but the beauty and
        artistic value of the "The End of the World" sequences in light of the revelation at the end of the novel is
        truly
        something special. This quality of this novel is made even more evident upon re-reading, with understanding of
        the
        true nature of "The End of the World", but nothing can quite replace the feeling of the "eureka" moment
        experienced
        during one's initial reading when this true nature is revealed. This is Murakami's most science-fiction-adjacent
        novel, with detailed explorations of fields such as acoustics, cryptology, and psychology. Coming in with a
        background in both the natural and formal sciences, reading this novel also made me realize one thing
        about Murakami: this is one smart man (although he may claim otherwise).
    </p>

    <h2>Norwegian Wood</h2>
    <h3>1987 | &#x1F431; <span style="color:gold">10</span>/10</h3>

    <p><em>Synopsis</em>: Toru, a college student, develops a bond with the longtime girlfriend (Naoko)
        of Toru's deceased best friend over their shared mourning of his death by suicide. As Naoko's mental
        health deteriorates, an outgoing female classmate, Midori, enters Toru's life. </p>
    <p><em>Thoughts</em>: The novel that propelled Murakami to worldwide fame. Opinions on this novel are extremely
        polarized. Most will either completely adore it or utterly despise it. I tend to side with the former opinion,
        although I do agree that this novel is not for everyone. Personally, I think I read this at the absolutely
        perfect time in my life, where I was both new to Murakami (this was my first Murakami novel) and in an
        emotionally vulnerable state. Thus, the overly sentimental nature of the novel, highlighted by Murakami's
        signature beautiful writing, was really able to speak to me and impart a lasting impression on me. In some
        ways, <em>Norwegian Wood</em> was able to fundamentally change who I was as a person, or at least set the
        stage for those changes to develop. For all these reasons, I kind of don't want to ever re-read this novel
        and risk ruining my positive opinion of it. But at the same time, I trust my ability to compartmentalize
        and preserve the memory of what this novel meant to me during my initial reading. Briefly, I think that
        those who dislike this novel have a misunderstanding of its core themes. To me, <em>Norwegian Wood</em>
        is a novel about the nature of life and death. This novel's detractors may be too hung up on its
        admittedly dissatisfying romantic storylines.</p>

    <h2>Dance Dance Dance</h2>
    <h3><em>Rat Series: Book 4</em></h3>
    <h3>1988 | &#x1F431; <span style="color:goldenrod">9.6</span>/10</h3>

    <p><em>Synopsis</em>: In the last installation in the Rat series, the protagonist, four and half years following
        the events of <em>A Wild Sheep Chase</em>, is still hung up on the events of the past. In his efforts
        to seek closure and to track down his vanished ex-girlfriend, he comes into contact with friends, old and new.
    </p>
    <p><em>Thoughts</em>: In my opinion, this is the most "Murakami" Murakami novel. Hundreds of pages of
        casually depressing events and contemplation about life with minimal plot development. Characters flit
        in and out of the narrator's life and all sorts of strange events accompany them. Murakami novels like
        this one really immerse you and make you feel like aspects of the story have bled into your
        daily life. Overall, I think this is the Murakami novel I will be able to re-read the most throughout
        my life. <em>Dance Dance Dance</em> ultimately focuses on atmosphere and vibes over plot without being
        overly powerful or gripping, granting it great re-reading value.</p>

    <h2>South of the Border, West of the Sun</h2>
    <h3>1992 | &#x1F431; 7.7/10</h3>

    <p><em>Synopsis</em>: A married man reconnects with his estranged childhood love interest, and struggles
        to reconcile his past and present.</p>
    <p><em>Thoughts</em>: This is actually one of Murakami's most beautifully written works. The plot and characters
        are also all classic Murakami. I think personal bias played a large role in my dislike of this novel, so
        this rating isn't a fair representation of the actual quality of the novel. The majority of Murakami's
        male protagonists are single men, so their various flings with married women are somewhat more morally
        acceptable (from the protagonist's perspective). However, in <em>South of the Border, West of the Sun</em>,
        the protagonist is a father of two in a stable, happy marriage. His attempts to justify his attraction
        towards his childhood love really did not sit right with me. I'm not the type to get too worked up about
        morally ambiguous protagonists, but I guess this subject just really struck a nerve with me.</p>

    <h2>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</h2>
    <h3>1994-1995 | &#x1F431; <span style="color:gold">10</span>/10</h3>

    <p><em>Synopsis</em>: Amidst one man's journey to find his missing cat, he finds out that his wife has left him.
        In his attempts to decipher her motivations and reconcile with her, he learns a great deal about himself.</p>
    <p><em>Thoughts</em>: Murakami's masterpiece. His deepest and most powerful work. If you were to only
        read one Murakami novel, this one should be the one. All the classic Murakami themes come together
        perfectly in order to tell a more serious story than the ones found in typical Murakami novels. Murakami isn't
        playing around here. This novel strikes at the core of what it means to be human and what it means to be alive.
        This isn't Murakami's longest novel (although it's up there), but it feels like it is. He's able to stuff so
        much meaningful material within the confines of the pages. It truly feels like each and every sentence was
        carefully crafted with the utmost intent and purpose. If Murakami is to win a Nobel Prize, this work will
        be the most significant contributor to that acheivement. Words really can't do it justice;
        you just have to read it yourself.</p>

    <h2>Sputnik Sweetheart:</h2>
    <h3>1999 | &#x1F431; 8.0/10</h3>

    <p><em>Synopsis</em>: A young man's love interest, Sumire, becomes interested in an older woman and departs
        with her to Europe. Upon being informed that Sumire has suddenly disappeared, he drops everything to
        travel to a Greek island to look for her.</p>
    <p><em>Thoughts</em>: A very solid effort that's able to package classic Murakami themes and characters into a
        novel and fresh reading experience. The island setting and unconvential relationships help to frame the
        typical Murakami happenings in a different light. I particularly liked the passages toward the end of the
        novel featuring the young boy, Carrot.</p>

    <h2>Kafka on the Shore</h2>
    <h3>2002 | &#x1F431; 8.5/10</h3>

    <p><em>Synopsis</em>: A teenage boy runs away from home and finds a place for himself in a private library.
        At the same time, an old man who can speak to cats is drawn towards the same library.</p>
    <p><em>Thoughts</em>: This is among Murakami's best-received and highest-rated novels, but I just... don't seem
        to understand the hype. I think it's definitely a great read, but the themes it tries to emulate are just
        executed better in other Murakami novels. None of the characters or scenes really stood out to me. Usually, I
        have at least one image or excerpt from a Murakami novel stick with me long after I've finished it. While
        reading <em>Kafka on the Shore</em>, I thought this would be the image of the titular painting or the appearance
        of
        Kafka's room in the library at night. However, the only memorable sections of this novel to me ended up being
        the few passages about Beethoven. Instead, I can praise <em>Kafka on the Shore</em> for being consistent.
        This novel makes for a very smooth and fluid read, with great pacing and timing. Perhaps, this novel was
        written for a larger reading audience (maybe young adult?), outside of the Murakami faithful. Thus, I think
        <em>Kafka on the Shore</em> makes for a good introductory Murakami novel. Nevertheless, I do think that I may
        have missed something during my initial reading of this novel, and I definitely need to re-read it to
        form a more developed opinion.
    </p>

    <h2>After Dark</h2>
    <h3>2004 | &#x1F431; 7.0/10</h3>

    <p><em>Synopsis</em>: Over one night in Tokyo, two young college students investigate the beating
        of a Chinese prostitute at a late night love hotel.</p>
    <p><em>Thoughts</em>: This is classic Murakami, written well and with an interesting plot. However, it's just
        too short and underdeveloped. The gimmick of this novel is that it's only set over the course of one night.
        However, this really hampers the development of the characters and the plot. Ultimately, nothing really happens
        in <em>After Dark</em>. The entire novel feels like a series of "what if?"s and "what could be?"s.</p>

    <h2>1Q84</h2>
    <h3>2009-2010 | &#x1F431; 8.7/10</h3>

    <p><em>Synopsis</em>: Two estranged childhood lovers, Tengo and Aomame, find themselves in a strange parallel
        world, spurred by their individual associations with a religious cult.</p>
    <p><em>Thoughts</em>: Murakami's longest novel has its moments of brilliance. In particular, the chapter featuring
        the "Town of Cats" story is one of my favorite passages across all of Murakami's works. Furthermore, Tengo
        is my all-time favorite Murakami protagonist. I could really empathize with his united interests in mathematics
        and literature. Murakami really isn't known for his writing of characters, but Tengo really stood out to me as
        a genuinely interesting and well-written character. It seemed that all of the characters associated with his
        side of the narrative also become captivating figures due to his presence. However, I didn't really care too
        much for Aomame's story or the background of the cult. Upon my initial reading of <em>1Q84</em>, I didn't really
        understand why the cult featured as such a big part of the story. Murakami rarely makes reference to religion in
        his works, so the appearance of a cult was unexpected. My later reading of Murakami's nonfiction work
        <em>Underground: The Tokyo Gas Attack and the Japanese Psyche</em>, which describes the Japanese Aum cult in
        considerable detail, greatly improved my understanding of the cult in 1Q84 (which parallels the Aum cult) and
        Murakami's motivation behind his inclusion of such a cult in <em>1Q84</em>.
    </p>
    <p><em>Side note</em>: <em>Underground</em> is a pretty good read, and I've enjoyed many of Murakami's other
        nonfiction works, but I don't quite like them enough to include reviews of them here. I think they make
        good reads for Murakami fanatics who want to further understand the personality behind the name, but much
        of their charm (outside of <em>Underground</em>) lies within a pre-existing familiarity with the man himself
        rather than the content of the works.</p>

    <h2>Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage</h2>
    <h3>2013 | &#x1F431; 7.8/10</h3>

    <p><em>Synopsis</em>: As a young college student, Tsukuru Tazaki is ostracized from his group of
        high-school friends for reasons unbeknownst to him. Many years later, he reconnects with his
        old friends in his attempts to seek closure.</p>
    <p><em>Thoughts</em>: This novel is a really pleasant read, but it ends up being a little basic for
        Murakami standards. I think it would have benefitted from a bit more literary depth and pizzazz -
        Murakami's hallmark is "unfinished" endings and unexplained happenings, but this novel was somewhat
        devoid of these elements. <em>Norwegian Wood</em> utilized a similar strategy, but it made up for these
        absences through emotional power. This novel definitely had the opportunities to do the same, but I think
        that Murakami wanted to write something a little simpler and happier. I just got the feeling that he
        wrapped everything up a little too nicely and clearly for my taste, aesthetically speaking.</p>

    <h2>Killing Commendatore</h2>
    <h3>2017 | &#x1F431; 8.4/10</h3>

    <p><em>Synopsis</em>: After his wife leaves him, a painter ends up moving into the house of a famous old
        painter. His discovery of an unreleased painting, the titular <em>Killing Commendatore</em>, in the house's
        attic kicks off a series of strange occurences in his life.</p>
    <p><em>Thoughts</em>: This novel didn't get much critical acclaim, but I think it's actually quite good.
        To me, this is Murakami's most plot-based novel. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the novel;
        which runs counter to the typical Murakami reading experience (leaning back into your seat). Murakami's
        musings about the painting experience also kind of run parallel to his statements about his own writing
        process (which he details in some of his nonfiction works). Similar to <em>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</em>,
        this novel is quite deep, touching upon fundamental aspects of the human experience. The extensive use
        of metaphor and allegory is also akin to <em>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</em>. Why is
        <em>Killing Commendatore</em> rated so lowly relative to these titles, then? The reason is that the ending
        is absolutely terrible, in my opinion. It greatly nullifies the meaning of the protagonist's final journey
        towards the novel's end, and I like to pretend that it never happened.
    </p>

    <h2>Short Story Collections</h2>
    <p><em>A note</em>: The overall collections are rated on the same scale as novels, but individual
        short stories are rated more leniently and can only achieve ratings that are multiples of 0.5.
        Highlighted short stories are listed by order of appearance within the collection.</p>

    <h2>The Elephant Vanishes</h2>
    <h3>1993 | &#x1F431; 9.3/10</h3>

    <p><em>Overall Thoughts</em>: My favorite Murakami short story collection, and the highest-quality collection,
        by far. This collection consists of works written from 1980 to 1991, comprising the first decade of Murakami's
        literary career. This is the ideal starting point for readers new to Murakami, as it covers a wide range
        of topics in short, digestible formats. The hope is that new readers will fall in love with at least one
        of the stories and leverage that momentum into reading full Murakami novels.</p>

    <h2>After the Quake</h2>
    <h3>2000 | &#x1F431; 8.0/10</h3>

    <p><em>Overall Thoughts</em>: The other must-read Murakami short-story collection. This collection
        contains stories written in 1999 and 2000 in response to the 1995 Kobe earthquake. The common themes
        of the stories in <em>After the Quake</em> make the collection feel cohesive, helping to impart
        an overarching message and provide a fluid reading experience. This collection is also the most consistent
        collection; all of the stories are of at least reasonably high quality.</p>

    <h3>Standout Stories</h3>

    <h3>Landscape with Flatiron | &#x1F431; 8.5/10</h3>

    <p><em>Thoughts</em>: </p>

    <h3>All God’s Children Can Dance | &#x1F431; <span style="color:gold">10</span>/10</h3>

    <p><em>Thoughts</em>: I just absolutely love the imagery of a man dancing on the pitcher's mound of an
        empty baseball field in the middle of the night, swinging his arms and body around like there's no
        tomorrow. It also helps that I love baseball (it's truly one of the most "romantic" sports). The rest
        of the story is... peculiar, but it gives enough background for this titular scene to make sense and have
        significance.</p>

    <h2>Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman</h2>
    <h3>2006 | &#x1F431; 7.4/10</h3>

    <p><em>Overall Thoughts</em>: Murakami's largest short story collection, consisting of stories written
        between 1980 and 2005. There are a few really great stories, many decent stories, and a few stinkers
        in this collection. This collection reads like an amalgamation of stories that didn't make the cut
        for <em>The Elephant Vanishes</em> and stories written since its publication. Ultimately, it's a
        worthwhile read, as it contains Murakami's single best short story (in my opinion).</p>

    <h3>Standout Stories</h3>

    <h3>The Seventh Man | &#x1F431; <span style="color:gold">10</span>/10</h3>

    <p><em>Thoughts</em>: This one is it. The magnum opus. Just read it. Murakami's writing here stands as a clear
        example of why he is among the literary giants of his time. The imagery of the boy's face in the wave...
        I've tried to imagine over and over exactly what his facial expression would look like.</p>

    <h3>A Shinagawa Monkey | &#x1F431; 9.5/10</h3>

    <p><em>Thoughts</em>: Truly only a subject only Murakami would think about and write about. A monkey stealing
        names... crazy, but genius.</p>

    <h2>Men Without Women</h2>
    <h3>2014 | &#x1F431; 7.2/10</h3>

    <p><em>Overall Thoughts</em>: This is a decent short story collection with a more modern focus. The common
        theme of male protagonists dealing with the loss of female figure in their lives helps to manifest an overall
        cohesiveness. This is another collection where all of the stories are of acceptable quality. Overall,
        <em>Men Without Women</em> makes for a pleasant reading experience.
    </p>

    <h3>Standout Stories</h3>

    <h3>Yesterday | &#x1F431; 9.5/10</h3>

    <p><em>Thoughts</em>: A pretty typical Murakami story; I just love the imagery of a "moon made of ice", observed
        from a boat surrounded by the dark ocean in the middle of the night. I get chills every time this scene has
        been described during my re-readings of this story.</p>

    <h2>First Person Singular</h2>
    <h3>2020 | &#x1F431; 7.0/10</h3>

    <p><em>Overall Thoughts</em>: Another modern collection of Murakami short stories; however, this collection
        feels a lot more disjointed than <em>Men Without Women</em>. The stories are mostly of decent quality,
        but cover a wide, inconsistent range of topics.</p>

    <h3>Standout Stories</h3>

    <h3>With the Beatles | &#x1F431; 9.5/10</h3>

    <p><em>Thoughts</em>: This story starts out pretty slow and a little uninteresting, but once the older brother
        of the protagonist's high school girlfriend appears, the rest of the story is up there with Murakami's
        absolute best writing. The delivery and the content itself really feels like something only Murakami
        could write.</p>
