    <h1>Murakami Haruki (村上春樹)</h1>

    <h2>Novels</h2>

    <h2>Hear the Wind Sing</h2>
    <h3><em>1979</em> | &#x1F431; 7.0/10</h3>

    <p><em>Synopsis</em>: A college student on summer break returns to his hometown
        and reconnects with his aloof friend at the local bar.</p>
    <p><em>Thoughts</em>: This novel doesn't seem to get a lot of love, even from Murakami fanatics,
        but I'm actually quite fond of it. The atmosphere is exquisite, and although Murakami himself
        may think differently, I don't see much of a gap between this work and his later works.
