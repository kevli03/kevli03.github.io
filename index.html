    <h1>Literature</h1>

    <h1>Murakami Haruki (村上春樹)</h1>

    <h2>Novels</h2>

    <h2>Hear the Wind Sing</h2>
    <h3><em>Rat Series: Book 1</em></h3>
    <h3>1979 | &#x1F431; 7.0/10</h3>

    <p><em>Synopsis</em>: A college student on summer break returns to his hometown
        and reconnects with his old friend (the titular "Rat") at the local bar. This student will reappear as
        the protagonist and narrator throughout the rest of the Rat series.</p>
    <p><em>Thoughts</em>: This novel doesn't seem to get a lot of love, even from Murakami fanatics,
        but I'm actually quite fond of it. The atmosphere is classic Murakami, and although Murakami himself
        may think differently, I don't see much of a gap between this work and his later works.</p>

    <h2>Pinball, 1973</h2>
    <h3><em>Rat Series: Book 2</em></h3>
    <h3>1980 | &#x1F431; 8.8/10</h3>

    <p><em>Synopsis</em>: Set a few years after the events of <em>Hear the Wind Sing</em>,
        our protagonist develops an obsession with the game of pinball and the Rat starts seeing a woman.</p>
    <p><em>Thoughts</em>: Again, this seems to be an uncommon opinion, but I think this is really, really good.
        At times, this reads like Murakami at his best. This is the first work where you can observe Murakami
        start to develop the common themes at the core of all his works. An analysis of the meaning of pinball
        in this novella can be found <a href="pinball.html">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>A Wild Sheep Chase</h2>
    <h3><em>Rat Series: Book 3</em></h3>
    <h3>1982 | &#x1F431; 8.0/10</h3>

    <p><em>Synopsis</em>: Murakami's first extended novel. Now in his 30s, our protagonist, accompanied by
        his girlfriend, explores the wintry landscapes of Hokkaido in pursuit of the traces of the Rat and a mysterious
        sheep with a star-shaped mark.</p>
    <p><em>Thoughts</em>: I really enjoyed the first half of this novel. It's about as Murakami as you can get,
        filled with lengthy exposition about subjects such as the history of Japanese sheep and the Ainu people
        with just enough interspersed plot development to keep readers engaged in the larger story. The second
        half of the novel is much more plot-focused and "engaging", but I didn't really find myself caring too much
        about the final fate of the Rat. Perhaps I just need to give this one a re-read.</p>

    <h2>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</h2>
    <h3>1985 | &#x1F431; <span style="color:gold">10</span>/10</h3>

    <p><em>Synopsis</em>: A middle-aged man is caught up in an information war between secretive opposing factions.
        In a parallel narrative, a newcomer to a mysterious town known as "The End of the World" seeks to
        uncover the truth behind the town's existence.</p>
    <p><em>Thoughts</em>: This could be Murakami's all-time best work. It doesn't have the emotional power of
        <em>Norwegian Wood</em> or the literary polish of <em>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</em>, but the beauty
        of the "The End of the World" sequences in light of the revelation at the end of the novel is truly something
        special. This quality of this novel is made even more evident upon re-reading, with understanding of the true
        nature of "The End of the World", but nothing can quite replace the feeling of the "eureka" moment experienced
        during one's initial reading when this true nature is revealed. This is Murakami's most science-fiction-adjacent
        novel, with detailed explorations of fields such as acoustics, cryptology, and psychology. Coming in with a
        background in both the natural and formal sciences, reading this novel also made me realize one thing
        about Murakami: this is one smart man (although he may claim otherwise).
    </p>

    <h2>Norwegian Wood</h2>
    <h3>1987 | &#x1F431; <span style="color:gold">10</span>/10</h3>

    <p><em>Synopsis</em>: Toru, a college student, develops a bond with the longtime girlfriend (Naoko)
        of Toru's deceased best friend over their shared mourning of his death by suicide. As Naoko's mental
        health deteriorates, an outgoing female classmate, Midori, enters Toru's life. </p>
    <p><em>Thoughts</em>: Opinions on this novel are extremely polarized. Most people will either completely
        adore it or utterly despise it. I tend to side with the former opinion, although I do agree that this novel
        is not for everyone. Personally, I think I read this at the absolutely perfect time in my life, where I was
        both new to Murakami (this was my first Murakami novel) and in an emotionally vulnerable state. Thus, the
        overly sentimental nature of the novel, highlighted by Murakami's signature beautiful writing, was really
        able to speak to me and impart a lasting impression on me. In some ways, <em>Norwegian Wood</em> was able
        to fundamentally change who I was as a person or at least set the stage for those changes to develop. For
        all these reasons, I kind of don't want to ever re-read this novel. But at the same time, I trust my ability
        to compartmentalize and preserve the memory of what this novel meant to me during my initial reading. Briefly, I
        think that those who dislike this novel have a misunderstanding of its core themes. To me, <em>Norwegian
            Wood</em>
        is a novel about the essence of life and death. This novel's detractors may be too hung up on its
        admittedly dissatisfying romantic storylines.</p>

    <h2>Dance Dance Dance</h2>
    <h3><em>Rat Series: Book 4</em></h3>
    <h3>1988 | &#x1F431; <span style="color:goldenrod">9.6</span>/10</h3>

    <p><em>Synopsis</em>: In the last installation in the Rat series, the protagonist, 4 and half years following
        the events of <em>A Wild Sheep Chase</em>, is still hung up on the events of the past. In his efforts
        to seek closure and to track down his vanished ex-girlfriend, he </p>
    <p><em>Thoughts</em>: In my opinion, this is the most "Murakami" Murakami novel. Hundreds of pages of
        depressing events and contemplation about life </p>
